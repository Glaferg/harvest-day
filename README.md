# harvest-day

a guy in glasses romances a peculiar little console with a sunshine (yellow) disposition.

Inspired by the brutally hard Activision cart *BOMBERMAN* for Atari 2600, the gaudy circus of neoclassical sensory overload called *JUGGLERX* on Itch.io, the sensation and fury of *Downwell*'s peculiar world, the unbearable magnamity of Stabyourself's *Not* series, and doused in the peculiar corruption which pervaded the time of *The Jungle* and the widespread perversion of the American Dream 

Not least of all the wonderful handheld which is the physical incarnation of Itch.io.

****A um... uh... Unique Game, Inspired By (or perhaps perpetrated by) Stabyourself****

Have you ever played Space Invaders and wondered, "Why don't the bullets fall back down? Why isn't the player buried in a spray of cartridges whenever it shoots?
And shouldn't the skeletons of the aliens tumble into a heap when they are shot?" ... you're a sick masochisoist who should be *shot* and a threat to the sensibility
of society. BUT, HOWEVER, MY BIZARRE GAME SHOULD CATER TO YOU!

Meet *Not Invaders*, a ridiculous mess of 2D physics that mimics the authentic experience of way back never when polygons piled and bullets bounced.

Here's to Stabyourself's searingly bizarre *Not* series for making us smash controllers and scream at tetrominoes in infuriating positions.
